Rustacean Hex Dump

## Description

This project was created for study purposes.

I set out this journey because I want to get familiar with Rust by actually
diving into coding and create something. Hopefully, I will become proficient
enough to write code which is comparable to writing the same thing in C.

That said, for the above purpose, I've spent a few days to get a piece of
code in C for dumping bytes in hexidecimals [here][1]. Now I am challenging
myself to come up with an equivalent with comparable efficiency while having
a rustacean coding style.

As a by-product, we want to have something sort of useful at the end. In
other words, surpassing the C counterpart is the ultimate goal.

Suggestions and comments are welcomed. Please feel free to drop me a line.
